# Timelapse-Spot Version 2.0: Rebuild my first full-stack project with new tech stacks and skills.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>My first full-stack project: www.timelapsespot.com. This is a website that allows photographers to add, review, rate timelapse spot(location).</p>
The website was almost identical to the full-stack project from the Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele. It didn't incorporate much of my own thinking or trial and error. Thus, after acquiring some new skills, I was eager to apply my newfound knowledge. I believe it's time to rebuild it from scratch.


<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>This is a <strong>MERN Stack, Next.js</strong> application <p> that will be deployed with <strong>Docker, CI/CD</strong>
  <ul>
    <strong><li>MongDB</li></strong> (A NoSQL database)
    <strong><li>Express.js</li></strong> (A backend frame work for Node.js)
    <strong><li>React.js</li></strong> (The JS frontend library/framwork)
    <strong><li>Node.js</li></strong> (The backend JS runtime)
  </ul>
