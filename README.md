# Timelapse-Spot Version 2.0: Rebuild my first full-stack project with new tech stacks and skills.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>My first full-stack project: www.timelapsespot.com. This is a website that allows filmmakers to add, review, rate timelapse spot(location).</p>
The website was almost identical to the full-stack project from the Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele. It didn't incorporate much of my own thinking or trial and error. Thus, after acquiring some new skills, I was eager to apply my newfound knowledge. I believe it's time to rebuild it from scratch.
