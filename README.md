# Version 2.0: Rebuild my first full-stack project with a new tech stack.

My first full-stack project: www.timelapsespot.com. This was essentially identical to the well-known YelpCamp. It didn't incorporate much of my own thinking or trial and error. Thus, After learned some new skills, I was eager to apply my newfound skills. I feel it's time to rebuild it from scratch.

This is a new MERN Stack Application that allows photographers to add, review, rate timelapse spots(locations).
